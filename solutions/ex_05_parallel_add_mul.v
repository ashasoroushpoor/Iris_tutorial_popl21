(**
In this exercise we consider a variant of the previous exercise. We have a
reference which is initially 0 and two threads running in parallel. One thread
increases the value of the reference by 2, whereas the other multiples the
value of the reference by two. An interesting aspect of this exercise is that
the outcome of this program is non-deterministic. Depending on which thread runs
first, the outcome is either 2 or 4.

There is no "fetch-and-multiply" operation in heap_lang, so we use the spin lock
from exercise 3 instead to make both the addition and the multiplication atomic.

Contrary to the earlier exercises, this exercise is nearly entirely open.

  Lemma ghost_var_alloc b :
    ⊢ |==> ∃ γ, own γ (●E b) ∗ own γ (◯E b).
  Proof.
    iMod (own_alloc (●E b ⋅ ◯E b)) as (γ) "[??]".
